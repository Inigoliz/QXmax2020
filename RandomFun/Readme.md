## Some random links about random topics

Let me now send you some random science links to cool ressources:

- [This](https://xkcd.com/505/) is a great place to find lots of comic-style funny pieces. Useful to free your mind.
- This is probably one of my favourite science divulgation channels: [Steve Mould's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D07aJB0Blzw) explanations are soo cool!
- [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-3fXU3FZQc) builds computers from electronic components in a totally inductive way and with great explanations. If you are brave enough you can even [buy](https://eater.net/shop) a bundle to create your own 8-bit computer. Either way, his videos are crazy satifying.
