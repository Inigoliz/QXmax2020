## Some random links about random topics

Let me now send you some random science links to cool ressources:

- [This](https://xkcd.com/505/) is a great place to find lots of comic-style funny pieces. Useful to free your mind.
- This is probably one of my favourite science divulgation channels: [Steve Mould's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D07aJB0Blzw) explanations are soo cool!
- [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-3fXU3FZQc) builds computers from electronic components in a totally inductive way and with great explanations. If you are brave enough you can even [buy](https://eater.net/shop) a bundle to create your own 8-bit computer. Either way, his videos are crazy satifying.

Finally, I have been obsessed from a time with productivity methods. You may know the usual **GTD**, by David Allen, to organize your projects and want-to-do, or the **Pomodoro** method, to focus better. But recently I have discovered a method to organize the things you learn eberyday and wish to conserve. Moreover, one of its cool applications is that it helps you build a mental network in the physical world, that you can use to organize your thoughts, come up with conclussions or power up your creativity. It is called **Zettelkasten** method, and you will find this article extremely inspirting: [How to make yourself into a learning machine](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-learning-machine).


Enjoy!!
