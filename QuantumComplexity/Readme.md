Hoho,

As you say that you wish to study and understand **Quantum Complexity Theory**, let me refer you to one of the greatest masters in the topic: Scott Aaronson:

- He wrote one of the best textbooks in the topic, starting simple but covering most of the topics until recent research: *Quantum Computing since Democritus*.
- He has a wonderful blog in which he posts about many topics. For example, check out [Procrastiantion](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?cat=3)
