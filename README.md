# QXmax2020
Happy QChristmas, Lia!

This 2020 comes (finally!) to an end. If we forget about all the difficulties that we have all had, it has been an interesting year in which we have learnt to focus more on ou necessities, enjoy loneliness and get to grow many personal skills. It is true that we have sacrified social interactions, but in spite of that now we are more aware of our own being.
Now I speak personally when I say that it has been the first time in a really long time in which I have been staring at a blank wall and felt bored. This seems so irrelevant, but please, try to think about the last time you had nothing to focus but your own mind and thoughts. We tend to live hectically, in a non-stop, constantly overflowded by stimuli and always involved in some projects. And that is great. But sometimes we forget that the true power of our mind comes from interconnecting different ideas. That is when creation happens.
To train and level up that ability it is a good practice to have some spare time every day (say 30') to disconnect, forget about all your worries and works going and let your mind flow.

This is going to be one of my new year proposals. Will you join me?


Apart from this small piece of thoughts, I have put together a **Learning Ressource** for you. It is variated and focused on different topics. But basically and given your background and interests, it is a set of interesting links to quantum complexity theory, some cool science divulgation channels, and some random things that I hope you find cool to watch.

Please, start the lunch by **QuantumComplexity**, follow by **RandomScience** and take RandomFun as a dessert.

Enjoy!
